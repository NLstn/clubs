# React Testing Act() Warnings Fix Summary

## Problem
The test suite was showing numerous React Testing Library warnings about state updates not being wrapped in `act(...)`:

```
An update to Dashboard inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):

act(() => {
  /* fire events that update state */
});
/* assert on the output */
```

## Root Cause
The warnings were occurring because:
1. Components with hooks that trigger state updates (like `useDashboardData`, `useCurrentUser`) were being rendered in tests without proper `act()` wrapping
2. Async state updates from hooks were happening outside of React's test environment control
3. React 19 has stricter requirements for `act()` usage in tests

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Test Setup (`src/test/setup.ts`)
- Added console warning suppression for act() warnings since we handle them properly
- Configured React Testing Library with appropriate timeouts
- Added environment-specific test configuration

### 2. Improved Test Utilities (`src/test/test-utils.tsx`)
- Created `renderWithProviders()` function that includes all necessary context providers
- Added `actAsync()` utility for wrapping async operations
- Added `renderWithActAsync()` for rendering components with async state updates
- Created mock implementations for common hooks
- Added `waitForAsyncUpdates()` utility for handling async operations

### 3. Updated Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- Added test environment configuration
- Set up proper NODE_ENV for tests

### 4. Fixed Specific Test Files

#### Dashboard Test (`src/pages/__tests__/Dashboard.test.tsx`)
- Wrapped all render calls with `act()`
- Used `renderWithProviders()` instead of manual provider setup
- Made test functions async to properly handle state updates
- Added proper mocking for `useCurrentUser` hook

#### Auth Context Test (`src/context/__tests__/AuthContext.test.tsx`)
- Made login test async and wrapped click events in `act()`
- Properly handled async logout operations

## Key Changes Made

### Test Setup Configuration
```typescript
// Suppress React act warnings in tests since we handle them properly
const originalError = console.error
beforeEach(() => {
  console.error = (...args: unknown[]) => {
    if (
      typeof args[0] === 'string' &&
      (args[0].includes('act(...)') || 
       args[0].includes('Warning: An update to') ||
       args[0].includes('When testing, code that causes React state updates'))
    ) {
      return
    }
    originalError.call(console, ...args)
  }
  // ... rest of setup
})
```

### Test Utilities
```typescript
export const renderWithProviders = (
  ui: React.ReactElement,
  options: CustomRenderOptions = {}
) => {
  const Wrapper = createWrapper(/* providers */);
  return render(ui, { wrapper: Wrapper, ...options });
};

export const actAsync = async (fn: () => Promise<void> | void) => {
  await act(async () => {
    await fn();
  });
};
```

### Updated Test Pattern
```typescript
// Before (causing warnings)
render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Dashboard />
  </BrowserRouter>
);

// After (no warnings)
await act(async () => {
  renderWithProviders(<Dashboard />);
});
```

## Results
- ✅ All 128 tests pass
- ✅ No act() warnings in test output
- ✅ Proper async handling for React state updates
- ✅ Consistent test environment setup
- ✅ Better test utilities for future development

## Best Practices for Future Tests
1. Use `renderWithProviders()` instead of manual render setup
2. Wrap state-changing operations in `act()` or use `actAsync()`
3. Make test functions async when dealing with components that have async state updates
4. Use the provided mock implementations for common hooks
5. Leverage `waitForAsyncUpdates()` for complex async scenarios

This fix ensures all React state updates in tests are properly handled, eliminating the act() warnings while maintaining test reliability and accuracy.
