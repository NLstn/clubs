# Club Management System - User Guide

## Joining Clubs

There are two ways for users to join clubs in the system:

### Method 1: Email Invitation (Admin → User)

**For Club Admins:**
1. Navigate to your club's admin panel
2. Go to the "Members" section
3. Click "Invite Member"
4. Enter the email address of the person you want to invite
5. Click "Send Invite"

**For Users Being Invited:**
1. You will receive an email notification about the invitation
2. Log into the club management system
3. Navigate to your profile → "Club Invitations"
4. You will see the pending invitation from the admin
5. Click "Accept" to join the club or "Decline" to reject the invitation

### Method 2: Invitation Link (User → Admin)

**For Club Admins:**
1. Navigate to your club's admin panel
2. Go to the "Members" section
3. Click "Generate Invite Link"
4. Copy the generated invitation link
5. Share this link with people you want to invite (via email, messaging, etc.)

**For Users Being Invited:**
1. Click on the invitation link shared by the club admin
2. If you're not logged in, you'll be redirected to the login page first
3. After logging in, you'll see the club information and join request page
4. Click "Request to Join" to send a join request
5. Your request will appear in the club admin's join requests list
6. Wait for the admin to approve your request before becoming a member

### Important Notes

- **Simplified system:** The system now has separate flows for invitations and join requests.
- **Email invitations:** When an admin invites someone via email, the invited user receives the invitation in their profile and can accept or decline it directly.
- **Invitation links:** When someone joins via an invitation link, they send a join request to the club admins for approval.
- **No dual approval:** Each method requires only one approval step, making the process much simpler.
- **Email invitations are personalized:** They are sent to specific email addresses and can only be accepted by the intended recipient.
- **Invitation links are shareable:** Anyone with the link can request to join the club.
- **Security:** Invitation links are secured by the authentication system - users must have an account and be logged in to use them.

### For Club Admins: Managing Invitations and Join Requests

**Sent Invitations (Admin invited, waiting for user):**
- Navigate to your club's admin panel
- Go to the "Members" section
- Click "View Pending Invites" to see invitations you've sent
- These are people you have invited via email who haven't responded yet

**Join Requests (User requested, waiting for admin approval):**
- Navigate to your club's admin panel
- Go to the "Members" section
- Click "View Join Requests" to see all pending join requests from users
- These are people who clicked your invitation link and want to join
- Review requests and approve or reject them as needed

### User Authentication

- The system uses magic link authentication
- Enter your email address to receive a login link
- Click the link in your email to log in
- Your session will be maintained for future visits

## Best Practices

### For Club Admins
- Use email invitations when you want to invite specific people
- Use invitation links when you want to share with a group or post publicly
- Regularly review and manage pending join requests
- Be mindful of who you share invitation links with

### For Users
- Check your email for invitation notifications
- Visit your profile regularly to see pending invitations
- Be patient after requesting to join - admins need to approve requests
- Make sure your profile is complete to help admins identify you

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Can't see invitation:** Check your spam folder for email invitations
- **Link doesn't work:** Make sure you're logged in before clicking invitation links
- **Request not approved:** Contact the club admin if your request is pending for a long time
- **Already a member error:** You may already be a member of the club
