# Club Management System - User Guide

## Joining Clubs

There are two ways for users to join clubs in the system:

### Method 1: Email Invitation

**For Club Admins:**
1. Navigate to your club's admin panel
2. Go to the "Members" section
3. Click "Invite Member"
4. Enter the email address of the person you want to invite
5. Click "Send Invite"

**For Users Being Invited:**
1. You will receive an email notification about the invitation
2. Log into the club management system
3. Navigate to your profile → "Club Invitations"
4. You will see the pending invitation (admin has already approved, waiting for your acceptance)
5. Click "Accept" to join the club or "Decline" to reject the invitation

### Method 2: Invitation Link

**For Club Admins:**
1. Navigate to your club's admin panel
2. Go to the "Members" section
3. Click "Generate Invite Link"
4. Copy the generated invitation link
5. Share this link with people you want to invite (via email, messaging, etc.)

**For Users Being Invited:**
1. Click on the invitation link shared by the club admin
2. If you're not logged in, you'll be redirected to the login page first
3. After logging in, you'll see the club information and join request page
4. Click "Request to Join" to send a join request (you are expressing interest)
5. Your request will appear in the club admin's pending requests list
6. Wait for the admin to approve your request before becoming a member

### Important Notes

- **Dual approval system:** The system uses a two-step approval process to ensure both parties agree to the membership.
- **Email invitations (Admin → User):** When an admin invites someone via email, the admin has already approved the request. The invited user will see this as a pending invitation they can accept or decline.
- **Invitation links (User → Admin):** When someone joins via an invitation link, they are expressing interest in joining. The user's request will appear in the admin's pending requests list for approval.
- **Both approvals required:** A user only becomes a member when both the admin and user have approved. This prevents unwanted memberships and ensures clear consent from both parties.
- **Email invitations are personalized:** They are sent to specific email addresses and can only be accepted by the intended recipient.
- **Invitation links are shareable:** Anyone with the link can request to join the club.
- **Security:** Invitation links are secured by the authentication system - users must have an account and be logged in to use them.

### For Club Admins: Managing Join Requests

**Pending Invitations (Admin invited, waiting for user):**
- These are people you have invited via email
- They appear in your "Sent Invitations" list
- No action needed - waiting for the user to accept

**Pending Requests (User requested, waiting for admin approval):**
1. Navigate to your club's admin panel
2. Go to the "Members" section
3. Click "View Pending Requests" to see all pending join requests from users
4. Review requests and approve or reject them as needed

**Note:** Users only become members when both admin and user have approved the membership.

### User Authentication

- The system uses magic link authentication
- Enter your email address to receive a login link
- Click the link in your email to log in
- Your session will be maintained for future visits

## Best Practices

### For Club Admins
- Use email invitations when you want to invite specific people
- Use invitation links when you want to share with a group or post publicly
- Regularly review and manage pending join requests
- Be mindful of who you share invitation links with

### For Users
- Check your email for invitation notifications
- Visit your profile regularly to see pending invitations
- Be patient after requesting to join - admins need to approve requests
- Make sure your profile is complete to help admins identify you

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Can't see invitation:** Check your spam folder for email invitations
- **Link doesn't work:** Make sure you're logged in before clicking invitation links
- **Request not approved:** Contact the club admin if your request is pending for a long time
- **Already a member error:** You may already be a member of the club
