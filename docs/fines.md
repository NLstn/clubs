# Fine Management

This guide explains how to manage fines in your club, including creating fine templates, issuing fines, and tracking payments.

## Understanding Fines

Fines are monetary penalties that can be assigned to club members for various reasons, such as:
- Missed events or meetings
- Late arrivals
- Rule violations
- Equipment damage
- Other club-specific infractions

The fine system includes:
- **Fine Templates**: Pre-defined fine types with default amounts
- **Individual Fines**: Specific fines issued to members
- **Payment Tracking**: Monitor paid and unpaid fines
- **Fine History**: Complete record of all fines

## Viewing Your Fines (Members)

To view your outstanding fines:

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**: Go to your main dashboard
2. **Check "My Fines"**: See all your unpaid fines
3. **View Fine Details**: Click on a fine to see:
   - Fine type and description
   - Amount owed
   - Date issued
   - Reason for the fine
   - Payment status

### Paying Fines

When you're ready to pay a fine:

1. **Select Fine**: Choose the fine you want to pay
2. **Mark as Paid**: Click the "Pay Fine" button
3. **Confirm Payment**: The system will record your payment

!!! note "Payment Process"
    The actual payment collection is typically handled outside the system (cash, bank transfer, etc.). This system tracks which fines have been marked as paid.

## Managing Fines (Administrators)

As a club administrator, you have full control over the fine system.

### Viewing All Club Fines

1. **Open Admin Panel**: Navigate to your club's admin section
2. **Go to "Fines"**: Select the fines management page
3. **View Fines List**: See all fines with:
   - Member names
   - Fine types
   - Amounts
   - Payment status
   - Issue dates

### Filtering Fines

Filter fines to find what you need:
- **By Status**: Paid or unpaid
- **By Member**: View fines for specific members
- **By Date**: Filter by date range
- **By Type**: Filter by fine template

## Fine Templates

Fine templates are pre-configured fine types that make issuing common fines quick and consistent.

### Creating Fine Templates

2. **Select "Fine Templates"**: Open the templates management page
3. **Click "Add Template"**: Start creating a new template
4. **Fill in Template Details**:
   - **Name**: Clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Missed Training")
   - **Description**: Explain what this fine is for
   - **Default Amount**: Set the standard fine amount
   - **Active**: Enable or disable the template
5. **Save Template**: Click save to create the template

    Create templates for your most frequent fines to speed up the process.

### Managing Fine Templates

Edit or remove existing templates:

2. **Select Template**: Click on a template to edit it
3. **Make Changes**: Update any template details
4. **Save or Delete**: Save changes or delete the template if no longer needed
