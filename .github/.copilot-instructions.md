# Club Management Application - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a club management application with a monorepo structure containing a Go backend and React TypeScript frontend. The application allows users to manage clubs, members, shifts, fines, and join requests through a RESTful API.

## Architecture & Technology Stack

### Backend (`/Backend`)
- **Language**: Go 1.24.0
- **HTTP Framework**: Built-in `net/http` library (NOT Gorilla Mux - uses standard library only)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with GORM ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with magic link email authentication
- **External Services**: Azure services for email (ACS) and identity
- **Key Features**:
  - Rate limiting with IP-based limiters
  - Custom middleware for CORS, logging, and authentication
  - RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes
  - Database migrations handled in main.go

### Frontend (`/Frontend`)
- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v7
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Styling**: CSS modules/vanilla CSS
- **Key Features**:
  - Protected routes with JWT authentication
  - Context-based auth state management
  - TypeScript for type safety

## Code Organization

### Backend Structure
- `main.go` - Application entry point, database migrations, server setup
- `handlers/` - HTTP request handlers organized by feature
  - `api.go` - Main handler registration and utility functions
  - `auth.go` - Authentication endpoints (magic links, JWT)
  - `clubs.go` - Club CRUD operations
  - `members.go` - Member management
  - `fines.go` - Fine management
  - `shift_schedules.go` - Shift scheduling
  - `join_requests.go` - Club membership requests
  - `user.go` - User profile management
  - `middlewares.go` - CORS, logging, rate limiting middleware
- `models/` - Database models and business logic
- `auth/` - JWT and authentication utilities
- `database/` - Database connection and configuration
- `azure/` - Azure SDK integrations
- `tools/` - Utility functions (frontend URL generation)

### Frontend Structure
- `src/pages/` - Page components organized by feature
- `src/components/` - Reusable components
- `src/context/` - React context providers (auth)
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions and API client

## Key Implementation Details

### HTTP Routing
- Uses standard `http.ServeMux` for routing with path parameters like `{clubid}`
- Custom `extractPathParam()` function for parameter extraction
- Method-based routing handled in handler functions with switch statements

### Authentication Flow
1. Magic link email authentication (no passwords)
2. JWT access tokens (short-lived) + refresh tokens (longer-lived)
3. `AuthMiddleware` validates Bearer tokens
4. User context passed through request context

### Database
- PostgreSQL with GORM ORM
- UUID primary keys for all entities
- Automatic migrations in main.go
- Environment-based configuration

### Rate Limiting
- IP-based rate limiting with different limits for auth vs API endpoints
- Custom `IPRateLimiter` implementation with cleanup routines
- Auth endpoints: 5 requests/minute
- API endpoints: 30 requests/5 seconds

## Development Guidelines

### Backend Conventions
- Use standard HTTP status codes consistently
- Always set `Content-Type: application/json` for JSON responses
- Extract user from request context using `extractUser(r)`
- Use GORM for database operations
- Handle errors with proper HTTP status codes
- Use rate limiting middleware for all endpoints
- Follow RESTful API design patterns
- **All timestamp fields in JSON responses must use camelCase format (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) and RFC3339 formatting for frontend compatibility**
- **When adding new models, always add them to the AutoMigrate call in `main.go` to ensure database tables are created properly**

### Frontend Conventions
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Implement proper error handling for API calls
- Use protected routes for authenticated pages
- Follow React 19 patterns and best practices
- Use context for global state management
- **Expect all date/timestamp fields from API responses to be in camelCase format and parse them using `new Date()` for display**

### Code Style
- Go: Follow standard Go conventions, use proper error handling
- TypeScript/React: Use functional components with hooks
- Consistent naming conventions across both codebases
- Proper separation of concerns between handlers, models, and business logic

## Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_PORT`, `DATABASE_USER`, `DATABASE_USER_PASSWORD`
- `FRONTEND_URL` - For generating magic links and redirects
- Azure-related configuration for email services

## API Documentation
Complete API documentation is available in `/Documentation/API.md`. This file contains:
- All endpoint specifications (25+ endpoints)
- Authentication flow and JWT token handling
- Request/response formats with JSON examples
- Rate limiting details
- Error response formats
- Complete parameter descriptions

**When making changes to the API, always reference and update this documentation.**

## Documentation Maintenance
When making API-related changes that should be documented:
1. **Always update `/Documentation/API.md`** when:
   - Adding new endpoints
   - Modifying existing endpoint parameters, responses, or behavior
   - Changing authentication requirements
   - Updating rate limiting rules
   - Adding new error responses
   - Modifying request/response formats

2. **API Documentation Update Process**:
   - Review existing documentation in `/Documentation/API.md`
   - Update the relevant sections to reflect your changes
   - Ensure JSON examples are accurate and complete
   - Maintain consistent formatting with existing documentation
   - Include proper HTTP status codes and error responses

## Important Notes
- **DO NOT use Gorilla Mux** - This project uses only the standard `net/http` library
- All routes use `http.ServeMux` with built-in path parameter support
- Rate limiting is implemented at the application level, not reverse proxy level
- Authentication is stateless JWT-based, no sessions
- Database connection pooling handled by GORM
- CORS is handled by custom middleware, not external packages
